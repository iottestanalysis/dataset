# Characterizing Tests in IoT Software
This repository contains all the data mentioned in the papers.

## Data overview
IOT_Data_Final-OverView.csv and IOT_Data_Final-CoreProjects.csv contain tabular format statistics for the 90 and 42 repositories mentioned in the paper, respectively.
These two files are summaries of each measure at the Project Level.

## Test Cases and LOC
The TestCases & LOC folder contains test cases for Python, Java and JavaScript, as well as statistics on the number of lines of code in the test cases.

## Distribution in Layers
We divide the distribution of Layers into Layer-Related, Layer-Only, and Multi-Layer according to the correlation between each project and Layer.
We put the projects in each category into a separate table format file, so that we can summarize the characteristics of different categories.

## Figures and Results
This folder contains a summary of statistics in the dataset, such as distribution of test cases, distribution of lines of code, test case popularity, etc.
