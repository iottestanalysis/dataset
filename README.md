# Characterizing Tests in IoT Software
This repository contains all the data mentioned in the papers.

## Data overview
Dataset-OverView.csv and Dataset-Core33.csv contain tabular format statistics for the 90 and 33 repositories mentioned in the paper, respectively.
These two files are summaries of each measure at the Project Level.

## Test Cases and LOC
The TestCases&LOC folder contains test cases for Python, Java and JavaScript, as well as statistics on the number of lines of code in the test cases.

## Distribution in Layers
We divide the distribution of Layers into Cloud Related, and Non Cloud according to the correlation between each project and Layer.
We put the projects in each category into a separate table format file, so that we can summarize the characteristics of different categories.
